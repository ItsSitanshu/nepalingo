# Nepalingo
Nepalingo is an app designed to help users learn and preserve the indigenous languages of Nepal through interactive lessons and engaging content.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by an open-source initiative from Incubate Nepal. While we drew inspiration from their work, Nepalingo is an independent project.
